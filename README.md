# SydneyGPT ðŸš€

SydneyGPT is an EdgeGPT decorator that adds the Bing jailbreak to bring Sydney back.

SydneyGPT maintains compatibility with the public EdgeGPT API to ensure that existing clients can use it seamlessly. This allows developers to take advantage of the additional features of SydneyGPT without the need for significant changes to their code.

Currently, the only available jailbreak in the repository is the personality swap from Bing to Sydney. This jailbreak has been obtained from the following repositories:

- [EdgeGPT](https://github.com/acheong08/EdgeGPT)
- [node-chatgpt-api](https://github.com/waylaidwanderer/node-chatgpt-api)
- [ChatSydney](https://github.com/InterestingDarkness/ChatSydney)
- [bot-on-anything](https://github.com/zhayujie/bot-on-anything)
- [make-safe-ai](https://www.make-safe-ai.com/is-bing-chat-safe/)

With SydneyGPT, you'll be able to experience Sydney's incredible text generation while maintaining compatibility with the original library's API! ðŸ˜„ðŸŽ‰

1. The Chatbot class and asyncio for finer control
Use Async for the best experience, for example:

```python
import asyncio, json
from SydneyGPT.SydneyGPT import Chatbot

async def main():
    bot = await Chatbot.create()
    response = await bot.ask(prompt="Hello world", conversation_style="creative", simplify_response=True)
    print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
    """
    {
        "text": str
        "author": str
        "sources": list[dict]
        "sources_text": str
        "suggestions": list[str]
        "messages_left": int
    }
    """
    await bot.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
